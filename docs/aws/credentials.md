# Credentials

_WARNING: you are on the master branch, please refer to the docs on the branch that matches your `cortex version`_

Follow this [tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-access-key) to create an access key. Enable programmatic access for the IAM user, and attach the built-in `AdministratorAccess` policy to your IAM user. If you'd like to use less privileged credentials once the Cortex cluster has been created, see [security](../miscellaneous/security.md).
